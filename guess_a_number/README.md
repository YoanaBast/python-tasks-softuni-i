Practical Project: Guess A Number

This is an additional practical project, and it is not mandatory and it is not included in the final score. The main purpose is to use the gained knowledge in different types of problems and to improve your portfolio and GitHub skills.

We will make the console game "Guess A Number". "Guess A Number" is a game in which your opponent, "the computer", chooses a random number between "1 and 100", and your task is to guess this number. After each number you enter, the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected until you guess the correct number
